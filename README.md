# QUEEN
A novel high-performance quadrature rule for BEM formulations
R. Velázquez-Mata, A. Romero, J. Domínguez, A. Tadeu, and P. Galvín have developed a MATLAB toolbox called QUEEN. The toolbox introduces a procedure that allows to compute of the boundary integral equations by numerical quadratures. The methodology is based on the computation of weights for the quadrature rules by the solution of an underdetermined system of equations in the minimum norm. The equations are obtained from the Cauchy Principal Value of known integrals that include the shape functions evaluated at the quadrature points to increase the accuracy. The proposed method can be used for any element and shape function using only numerical integration. QUEEN 1.1 MATLAB toolbox is available for further research. You can download the QUEEN 1.1 source file (January 25th 2023) here, and an example of the performance here. QUEEN 1.0 allows the computation of the Cauchy Principal Value or Hadamard Finite Part of integrals with singularities of the type log(r), 1/r, and 1/r^2.
